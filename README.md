# Base 12 Mathematics

This project is dedicated to understanding the Base 12 Mathematics concepts shared by the Taygetean and Swaruunian team.

Base 12 Mathematics seeks to provide a model for the creation of toroids at the energetic/magnetic level. As an electronic and computer engineer I am firmly convinced that there is something more behind the information shared by the Taygetan and Swarunnian people, information that can be read by visiting [www.swaruu.org](https://www.swaruu.org/).

Because the concepts shared by the Taygetians and the Swaruunians are new and there are no visual models, I have decided to create a series of gifs or a 3D model in hopes it will help others better understand the shared concepts.

It should also be noted that the information that the Taygetans and Swaruunians have revealed is incomplete and limited. Therefore, the created gifs and animations are based on my own understanding, knowledge and analysis of the information. This with the aim of expanding the knowledge of this exciting topic.

## Torus Energy Dynamics Gifs

The gifs that I have created below are an attempt to understand the flow of energy for the creation of a true energy torus.

A toroid can be created simply by energizing a doughnut-shaped coil. However, this type of toroid constantly loses its energy since there is no energy dynamics that help the energy/magnetism feed back into the system. Therefore these toroids are not really true toroids, although they have their applications (e.g., radio antennas). What is sought here is to find a geometric pattern that helps the energy emitted by the toroid feed back into the system, a true energy toroid.

Therefore, for the energy to be fed back into the system, two energy dynamics with perfect balance are required. A dynamic that magnetically attracts the energy released from the first and vice versa in the next cycle.
